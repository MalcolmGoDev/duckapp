# 🦆 Duck Detector 3000

Point your camera at anything yellow — rubber ducks, bananas, post-its, you name it!

## How it works

- Uses your device camera to scan for yellow pixels in real-time
- Converts RGB to HSL color space to detect yellow hues (35-65°)
- When 15%+ of the frame is yellow → **DUCK DETECTED!** 🎉
- Celebrates with confetti, floating ducks, and a quack sound

## Try it

Just open `index.html` in a browser, or deploy to Vercel/Netlify.
